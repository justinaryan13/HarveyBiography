            <h1>Journey</h1>
            <p>Harvey Specter's journey begins long before he becomes one of the top corporate lawyers in New York. Harvey excelled academically and eventually attended Harvard Law School, a prestigious institution that became a defining part of his identity. While there, he proved himself to be intelligent, confident, and competitive traits that would later define his career. After graduating, he started working in the District Attorney's Office, where he gained a reputation for his sharp legal mind and fearless approach to cases. However, he soon realized that working as a public servant limited his ambition and financial aspirations.</p>
            <p>Jessica Pearson, recognizing his potential, recruited him to Pearson Hardman, where Harvey quickly rose through the ranks. As a young lawyer, he proved himself as a closer someone who could seal deals and win cases with sheer confidence and strategy. However, his journey at the firm was not without challenges. He had to navigate office politics, rivalries, and ethical dilemmas while maintaining his high success rate. Over time, he built strong yet complicated relationships with key figures like Louis Litt, Donna Paulsen, and later, Mike Ross.</p>
            <p>Hiring Mike Ross, despite knowing he never attended law school, was one of the biggest risks Harvey ever took. This decision tested his moral boundaries and forced him to grow, not just as a lawyer but as a person. Throughout his career, he evolved from someone who only cared about winning to a leader who valued integrity, loyalty, and personal relationships. Eventually, after years of success, betrayals, and self-discovery, Harvey chose happiness over power, stepping away from the firm to start a new life with Donna Paulsen.</p>
            <p>Harvey's journey from a determined Harvard Law student to one of the most powerful lawyers in New York is a testament to his resilience, intelligence, and emotional growth. He learned that true success isn't just about being the best lawyer in the room, it's about who you choose to have by your side.</p>
